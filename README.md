# Fake-News-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Fake news detection using machine learning involves training models on datasets of verified and false news to automatically identify and classify new articles based on patterns and features indicative of misinformation.
<p>This project aims to create a robust fake news detection system using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to identify and classify news articles as real or fake, helping users discern the credibility of the content they encounter online.</p>
